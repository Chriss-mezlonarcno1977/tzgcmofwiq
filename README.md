Wow, man, just walked out of this hurricane of a movie, Squad 36. My head’s spinning like a merry-go-round on caffeine. Honestly, feels like I’ve got popcorn bouncing inside my skull instead of thoughts. I can still hear the crunching, but maybe that’s just my nerves jittering.

This film, oh wow, it hits like a hammer on a piano. But gentle and absurd at the same time. Like if Salvador Dali directed an action flick? There’s this one scene — can’t get it out of my head — the main guy, Raoul?, standing there, rain pouring all dramatic and poetic, while he spouts some nonsense about time being a carrot. What was that even about?? But I loved it, like being tickled by a philosophical porcupine.

> The theater was chaotic, people shuffling, latecomers rustling like dry leaves in autumn. My back aches from the cramped seating — how do they make them so uncomfy? — and I’m covered in popcorn dust, like a walking snack. Doesn’t matter though, cause the movie’s a total mind loop. Download the movie if you want to see weirdly profound dialogue mixed with explosions — it’s a trip!

Oh! That scene where the llama (yeah, an actual llama, what a trip) launches a surprise attack. I mean, what? I nearly spit out my drink, it was that bonkers. Who even thinks of that, llamas in combat gear? Felt like being inside a meme.

Everything was loud and colorful, like stuffing a rainbow inside a microwave and setting it on full blast. But then, subtly, they slip in this haunting melody, puts you in a trance like hypno popcorn. And the villain? Could’ve sworn he was a toaster in my dreams last night, ha! Brings a weird charm, like a pet rock with attitude.

Watch the movie if you’re into that whole “what the hell did I just watch” vibe. It’s not a film, it’s more an experience, a rollercoaster through someone’s wacky daydream.

Oh and, uh, here’s some random code that accidentally pasted in. Whoops:
```javascript
function unexpectedTwist() {
    var plot = [];
    var logic = null;
    if (coherence > 9000) {
        return Too structured!;
    }
}
```
Anyway, tell me if you end up seeing it. We definitely gotta talk about the llamas.
